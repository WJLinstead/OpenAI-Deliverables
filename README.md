## What is OpenAI?

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of both a for-profit corporation, OpenAI LP, and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. It was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman. The organization's goal is to advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a safe and beneficial manner for humanity.

It is most known for the GPT Series and DALL-E. 

The GPT Series is a large-scale language model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.  
DALL-E is an AI model developed by OpenAI capable of generating images from textual descriptions. It can create images of objects, scenes, and concepts that it has not seen before based on the provided text input.

In this project we will be focusing on the GPT Series.
